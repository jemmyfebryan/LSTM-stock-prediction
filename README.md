I made 90 LSTM models for different time spans like daily, quarterly, and yearly. I trained these models and compared them with others like ARIMA, ANN, SVM, etc. Turns out, LSTM performed the best with the least errors (MSE) for certain stocks and time frames.

The stock/index are IHSG, LQ45, BBCA, ADRO, ASII, KLBF, TLKM, CPIN, ARMT, and WIKA with the time spans Daily, Quarterly, Yearly.
